# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This repository is for the AMOS 2025 Robot Visual Perception project. It is organized around clear separation of deliverables, documentation, and (presumably) source code, though no code is present yet. The structure is designed for academic or research project workflows, with a focus on iterative deliverables and documentation.

## Directory Structure
- `Deliverables/`: Place for uploadable files (e.g., PDFs, images, non-code assets). Each sprint should have its own subfolder (e.g., `sprint-01/`).
- `Documentation/`: Contains build, user, and technical documentation, including software architecture descriptions.
- `README.md`: Top-level project overview. Update this as the project evolves.

## Key Conventions
- **Deliverables** must be organized by sprint in dedicated subfolders under `Deliverables/`.
- **Documentation** should be placed in `Documentation/` and kept up to date with architectural and technical changes.
- **Source code** location is not yet defined; follow team conventions or clarify with maintainers if adding code.

## Workflows
- **Adding Deliverables:**
  - Place files in the correct sprint subfolder under `Deliverables/`.
- **Updating Documentation:**
  - Add or update files in `Documentation/` as the project evolves.
- **Sprint Organization:**
  - Each sprint should have a dedicated folder for its outputs.

## Patterns & Practices
- Keep all non-code assets out of the source code directories.
- Maintain clear separation between deliverables, documentation, and code.
- Follow academic/research project standards for documentation and deliverable organization.

## Examples
- To add a sprint report: `Deliverables/sprint-02/Report.pdf`
- To update architecture docs: `Documentation/architecture.md`

## When in Doubt
- If unsure where to place a file, consult the `README.md` or ask a maintainer.
